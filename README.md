Google Sheets
===============
A sample app that authenticates with, and gets data from the Google Sheets API.



## Getting Set Up
You will need to [create an app](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) and enable the Google Sheets and Google Plus APIs. Then get the client ID and secret, and set in the `.env` file.

Be sure to set your Glitch project URL with '/login/google/return' appended to the end in the `Authorized redirect URIs` field for your app.
