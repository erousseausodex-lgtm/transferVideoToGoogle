Google Sheets Example
========================

This app is a building block for using Google Sheets.

## Getting Set Up
You will need to [create an app](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) and enable APIs to obtain the ID and secret required to be set in the `.env` file.

Be sure to set your Glitch project URL with '/login/google/return' appended to the end in the `Authorized redirect URIs` field for your app.
